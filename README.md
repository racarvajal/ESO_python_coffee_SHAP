Introduction to SHAP analysis of ML models

Short explanation of the use of SHAP analysis for the selection of relevant features in regular functions and Machine Learning (ML) models.

A first example with a toy function is shown. It is followed by an astrophysical example for the prediction of redshift values in QSOs in the SDSS-DR16Q sample. Finally, an astrophysics-based example with images is presented.
